# Hey, I am LORD

I’m the kind of person who gets an idea at 2 AM and ends up coding it by 3.  
Machine Learning, automation, and creative experiments — that’s my playground.

Right now, I’m building small but powerful tools that make everyday things smarter, smoother, or just plain cooler.

## What I’m Into

- Making chatbots that actually understand you (not just repeat keywords)
- Building ML models that learn from your own data
- Automating boring stuff so I can focus on the fun parts
- Experimenting with neural networks, transformers, and AI logic
- Mixing code with creativity — games, tools, visuals, and more

## A Few Things I’ve Built

| Project | Description | Stack |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [chat_bot](https://github.com/lord230/chat_bot) | A simple way to train your own LLM chatbot using WhatsApp or personal data | Python, Transformers |
| [LAN-TRANSFER](https://github.com/lord230/LAN-TRANSFER) | Send files over your local network with GUI and CLI support | Python, Tkinter |
| [auto-scheduling](https://github.com/lord230/auto-scheduling) | A smart task planner that auto-manages your schedule | HTML, JS, Python |
| [Progress](https://github.com/lord230/Progress) | A crazy but fun way to track your goals visually | Python |
| [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/lord230/Mandelbrot) | Because fractals never get old | HTML, Canvas |
| [tumore_detection_v1](https://github.com/lord230/tumore_detection_v1) | ML model for basic tumor prediction | Python, OpenCV |

If you like exploring random yet oddly useful projects, that’s pretty much my entire profile.

## Tech I Play With

Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C++  
PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Flask, Streamlit  
VS Code, Git, Linux, and late-night debugging

---

## What’s Cooking

- A modular AI assistant that grows with your data  
- Smarter transformer pipelines for personal use  
- More small utilities that make tech a little more human

Code. Break. Fix. Learn. Repeat.  
That’s the loop I live in.
